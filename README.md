# Factor_Analysis

The project presents a comprehensive factor analysis of essential variables in the diabetes data and latent dimensions influencing metabolic health. Utilizing Factor Analysis, the underlying structure of key factors such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and various serum measurements (S1-S6) are explored. The KMO Measurement of the data is computed to find it suitable for the factor analysis. Bartlett's test of sphericity is implemented, and the chi-square value and p-value are determined for the data.The findings reveal distinct factors are associated with these variables, providing insights into their interrelationships and contributions to overall metabolic conditions. Factor loadings and contributions of each variable to identified factors are analyzed. With the help of Factor loadings, the Communalities and Specific Variances of the corresponding loadings are determined. The latent factors that contribute to diabetes are found and evaluated using the loadings of the factors and the variances of corresponding factors. The results offer an understanding of the complex nature of diabetes-related features, contributing to a deeper comprehension of the factors influencing metabolic health. The study provides a structured exploration of latent factors in diabetes, opening avenues for targeted interventions and personalized healthcare strategies.
